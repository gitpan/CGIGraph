v.93
fixed various bugs (thanks to Joseph P.)
added a simple test script (try 'make test')

v.92

added 'new' function in CGI::Graph.pm. You can use it like this:
$myGraph = new CGI::Graph($hash_reference);
This should allow you to pass in a hash reference and have the correct graph type returned to you.
The object will not actually be of the type CGI::Graph, but a dervived class.
